Act as a senior full‑stack developer. Extend my existing “Anjulrajam Hibiscus Bhringraj Hair Oil” e‑commerce site with REAL online payments, proper COD logic, and order notifications. Use clean HTML/CSS/JS on the frontend and a simple Node/Express backend inside this project.

PAYMENT METHODS ON CHECKOUT

On the checkout page, add a “Payment Method” section with two radio options:
a) Online Payment (Prepaid)
b) Cash on Delivery (COD)

When the user switches between these options, update the order summary LIVE:

If Online Payment (Prepaid) → courier charge = ₹0 (free shipping).

If COD → courier charge = ₹70, and show this text clearly near it:
“For Cash on Delivery, you pay ₹70 courier charge in advance. The remaining product amount is payable in cash at delivery.”

The order summary must always show: Product total, Courier charge, Grand total.​

REAL RAZORPAY PAYMENT GATEWAY

Integrate Razorpay Standard Checkout as a REAL payment gateway (not a simulation).

Use a Node/Express backend with these endpoints:

POST /api/create-order

Input: customer details, cart items, totals, selected payment method.

If payment method = “Prepaid”, create a Razorpay order using RAZORPAY_KEY_ID and RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET (stored in environment variables).

Return to the frontend: Razorpay order id, amount, currency, and any other data needed to open Razorpay Checkout.

POST /api/razorpay-webhook

Verify the Razorpay signature.

On successful payment, mark the order as “paid” in the database or JSON file used for storage.

On the frontend, when the customer clicks “Pay Now” for prepaid:

Call /api/create-order.

Use the response to open Razorpay Checkout.

On successful payment, show an Order Confirmation page and trigger order emails.

Keep all Razorpay keys in an environment/config file as:
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID = "YOUR_KEY_ID_HERE"
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET = "YOUR_KEY_SECRET_HERE"​

COD WITH ADVANCE COURIER PAYMENT

If the user selects COD:

First, charge ₹70 via Razorpay as an “advance courier fee”.

After the ₹70 payment is successful, create an order with status “COD – Courier Paid”.

Show a confirmation message that clearly states:
“₹70 courier charge has been paid online. Please pay the remaining product amount in cash at the time of delivery.”

SEND ORDER DETAILS TO STORE OWNER EMAIL

After an order is confirmed (prepaid success OR COD courier fee success), send an email to the store owner using a mail library like Nodemailer.

Email details:
From: no-reply@anjulrajam.in (or similar)
To: anjulrajam@gmail.com
Subject: New Order – Anjulrajam Hibiscus Bhringraj Hair Oil
Body: include customer name, email, phone, WhatsApp number, full address, payment method, courier charge, totals, order id, and payment status.

Keep this email in config/env as:
STORE_OWNER_EMAIL = "anjulrajam@gmail.com"​

CUSTOMER ORDER CONFIRMATION EMAIL

After successful payment (prepaid or COD courier), send an order confirmation email to the customer’s email entered at checkout.

Subject: Your Anjulrajam hair oil order is confirmed – Order #{orderId}

Body: thank you message, order summary (products, quantity, price), payment method, amount already paid, amount due on delivery for COD, estimated delivery time, and support contacts:

Email: anjulrajam@gmail.com

WhatsApp helpline: 8755373247

WHATSAPP CONTACT INTEGRATION (LIGHTWEIGHT)

In the checkout form, add a field for the customer’s WhatsApp number.

Store this value with the order.

On the Order Confirmation page, show a “Contact us on WhatsApp” button linking to:
https://wa.me/8755373247?text=Hi%20I%20have%20a%20question%20about%20my%20order%20{orderId}

Also show the WhatsApp helpline number in the site footer and on the Contact page as:
“WhatsApp Helpline: 8755373247”

In config/env, set:
STORE_WHATSAPP_NUMBER = "8755373247"​

BASIC ADMIN ORDERS VIEW

Add a simple /admin/orders page (a very basic password check is enough) that lists all orders from storage.

For each order show: order id, date/time, customer name, payment method (Prepaid or COD), payment status, total, courier charge, and order status.

Allow changing order status (New, Packed, Shipped, Delivered) and saving it.

CONFIG SUMMARY AND CLEAN CODE

Put all important settings in a single config or .env file and document them in a short README section:
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET
STORE_OWNER_EMAIL = "anjulrajam@gmail.com"
STORE_WHATSAPP_NUMBER = "8755373247"
COURIER_CHARGE_COD = 70

Keep the code modular, well‑structured, and easy for a beginner to read and edit later.

Use the existing design, colors, and product name “Anjulrajam Hibiscus Bhringraj Hair Oil”. Do not change layout unnecessarily; just add these payment, COD, email, and WhatsApp features cleanly.
